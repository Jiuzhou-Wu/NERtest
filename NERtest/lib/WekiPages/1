&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Autism''' is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] characterized by impaired [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]], [[language acquisition|verbal]] and [[non-verbal communication]], and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their [[developmental milestones]] at a normal pace and then [[Regressive autism|regress]].&lt;ref name=Stefanatos/&gt; The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|diagnostic criteria]] require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{vcite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Autism Spectrum Disorder, 299.00 (F84.0) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pagex = 50–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;
While autism is highly heritable, researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaste P, Leboyer M |title=Autism risk factors: genes, environment, and gene-environment interactions |journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience |volume=14  |pages=281–92 |year=2012 |pmid=23226953 |pmc=3513682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents that cause birth defects]].&lt;ref name=Arndt/&gt; [[Controversies in autism|Controversies]] surround other proposed environmental [[Causes of autism|causes]];&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt; for example, the [[MMR vaccine controversy|vaccine hypotheses]], which have since been disproven.

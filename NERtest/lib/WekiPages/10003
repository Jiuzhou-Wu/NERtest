The '''M'Naghten rule''' (pronounced, and sometimes spelled, '''McNaughton''') is any variant of the 1840's jury instruction in a [[criminal case]] when there is a [[defense of insanity]], &quot;that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and... that to establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.&quot;&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], ISBN 978-1-4548-0698-1, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|632}} It emphasizes cognition (knowledge), as compared to the [[American Law Institute]] [[Model Penal Code]] test ([[ALI test]]), which broadened knowledge to include capacity to appreciate the criminality of conduct, and a volitional element as to capacity to conform to the law.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|615}} In the 1960's, the ALI test mostly replaced the M'Naughten rule in America until the 1980's, when in the aftermath of [[John Hinckley]] shooting [[President Ronald Reagan]], many ALI states returned to a variation of M'Naughten.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|615}}   

The rule was formulated as a reaction to the acquittal in 1843 of [[Daniel M'Naghten]] on the charge of murdering [[Edward Drummond]], whom M'Naghten had mistaken for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]].&lt;ref&gt;''M’Naghten’s Case'' [1843] All ER Rep 229&lt;/ref&gt; M'Naghten fired a pistol at the back of Peel's secretary, Edward Drummond, who died five days later. The [[House of Lords]] asked a panel of judges, presided over by [[Nicolas Conyngham Tindal|Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal]], [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]], a series of hypothetical questions about the defence of insanity. The principles expounded by this panel have come to be known as the ''M'Naghten Rules'', though they have gained any status only by usage in the common law and M'Naghten himself would have been found guilty if they had been applied at his trial.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Elliott, ''The rules of insanity: moral responsibility and the mentally ill offender'', SUNY Press, 1996, ISBN 0-7914-2951-2, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Molan, Mike Molan, Duncan Bloy, Denis Lanser, ''Modern criminal law'' (5 ed), Routledge Cavendish, 2003, ISBN 1-85941-807-4, p.352&lt;/ref&gt;  The rules so formulated as ''M'Naghten's Case'' 1843 10 C &amp; F 200&lt;ref name=&quot;m'naghtenscase&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=United Kingdom House of Lords Decisions|title=DANIEL M'NAGHTEN'S CASE.

When the tests set out by the Rules are satisfied, the accused may be adjudged &quot;not guilty by reason of insanity&quot; or &quot;guilty but insane&quot; and the [[sentence (law)|sentence]] may be a mandatory or discretionary (but usually indeterminate) period of treatment in a secure hospital facility, or otherwise at the discretion of the [[court]] (depending on the country and the offence charged) instead of a punitive disposal.

The insanity defence is recognized in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and most [[U.S. state]]s with the exception of Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Utah, and Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=13&amp;Chapter=157&amp;Section=04802|title=Vermont Statutes Online|website=www.leg.state.vt.us|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all of these jurisdictions still use the M'Naghten Rules.

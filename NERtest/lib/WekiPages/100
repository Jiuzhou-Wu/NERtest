&lt;!-- Terminology --&gt;

'''Abortion''' is the ending of [[pregnancy]] by removing a [[fetus]] or [[embryo]] before it can [[fetal viability|survive outside the uterus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot; group=&quot;note&quot; /&gt; An abortion which occurs spontaneously is also known as a [[miscarriage]]. An abortion may be caused purposely and is then called an [[#Induced|induced abortion]], or less frequently, &quot;induced miscarriage&quot;. The word ''abortion'' is often used to mean only induced abortions. A similar procedure after the fetus could potentially survive outside the womb is known as a &quot;[[late termination of pregnancy]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=DA |last2=Stuart |first2=G |title=Abortion jabberwocky: the need for better terminology |journal=Contraception |year=2010 |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=93–6 |pmid=20103443 |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2009.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We computed wider intervals for unsafe abortion rates than for safe abortion rates.

'''''Marbury v. Madison''''', {{ussc|5|137|1803}}, was a [[list of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court formed the basis for the exercise of [[judicial review in the United States]] under [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. The landmark decision helped define the boundary between the [[Separation of Powers|constitutionally separate]] [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches of the [[Federal government of the United States|American form of government]].

The case resulted from a petition to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] by [[William Marbury]], who had been appointed [[Justice of the Peace]] in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] by President [[John Adams]] but whose [[Letters patent|commission]] was not subsequently delivered. Marbury petitioned the Supreme Court to force the new Secretary of State, [[James Madison]], to deliver the documents. The Court, with [[John Marshall]] as Chief Justice, found firstly that Madison's refusal to deliver the commission was both illegal and correctible. Nonetheless, the Court stopped short of ordering Madison (by writ of ''[[mandamus]]'') to hand over Marbury's commission, instead holding that the provision of the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] that enabled Marbury to bring his claim to the Supreme Court was itself unconstitutional, since it purported to extend the Court's [[original jurisdiction]] beyond that which Article III established. The petition was therefore denied.

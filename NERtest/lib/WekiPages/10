The '''Academy Awards''', or &quot;'''Oscars'''&quot;, is an annual  American awards ceremony hosted by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements in the United States [[film industry]] as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a statuette, officially called the Academy Award of Merit, which has become commonly known by its nickname &quot;Oscar.&quot; The awards, first presented in 1929 at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]], are overseen by AMPAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html|title=About the Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=13 April 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407234926/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html|archivedate=7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273341,00.html|title=The Birth of Oscar|first=Andrew|last=Essex|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=14 May 1999|accessdate=2 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111215005/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273341,00.html|archivedate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

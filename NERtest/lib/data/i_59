
Alexandra
instance
Alexandra (Greek: Ἀλεξάνδρα) is the feminine form of the given name Alexander, which is a romanization of the Greek name Ἀλέξανδρος (Alexandros). Etymologically, the name is a compound of the Greek verb ἀλέξειν (alexein) \"to defend\" and ἀνήρ (anēr) \"man\" (ἀνδρός andros). Thus it may be roughly translated as \"defender of man\" or \"protector of man\". The name was one of the titles or epithets given to the Greek goddess Hera and as such is usually taken to mean \"one who comes to save warriors\". The earliest attested form of the name is the Mycenaean Greek 𐀀𐀩𐀏𐀭𐀅𐀨, a-re-ka-sa-da-ra, written in the Linear B syllabic script.

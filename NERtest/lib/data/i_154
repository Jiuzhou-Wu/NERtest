instance
NetHack is a single-player roguelike video game originally released in 1987 with ASCII graphics. It is a descendant of an earlier game called Hack (1985), which is a descendant of Rogue (1980). Comparing it with Rogue, Engadget's Justin Olivetti wrote that it took its exploration aspect and \"made it far richer with an encyclopedia of objects, a larger vocabulary, a wealth of pop culture mentions, and a puzzler's attitude.\" In 2000, Salon described it as \"one of the finest gaming experiences the computing world has to offer.\" The player chooses a character class and their mission is to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor in a randomly generated dungeon.

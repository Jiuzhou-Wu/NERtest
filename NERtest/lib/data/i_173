instance
George Abbot (19 October 1562 â€“ 5 August 1633) was an English divine who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1611 to 1633. He also served as the fourth Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, from 1612 to 1633. The Chambers Biographical Dictionary describes him as \"[a] sincere but narrow-minded Calvinist\". Among his five brothers, Robert became Bishop of Salisbury and Maurice became Lord Mayor of London. He was a translator of the King James Version, and is the only Archbishop of Canterbury ever to have killed a man,[citation needed] although the killing was entirely accidental.

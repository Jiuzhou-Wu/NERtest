instance
Abbas II Hilmi Bey (also known as ‘Abbās Ḥilmī Pasha) (Arabic: ) (14 July 1874 – 19 December 1944) was the last Khedive (Ottoman viceroy) of Egypt and Sudan, ruling from 8 January 1892 to 19 December 1914. In 1914, after Turkey joined the Central Powers in World War I, the nationalist Khedive was removed by the British, then ruling Egypt, in favor of his more pro-British uncle, Hussein Kamel, marking the de facto end of Egypt's four-century era as a province of the Ottoman Empire, which had begun in 1517.

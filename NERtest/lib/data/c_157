
Salinity
class
Salinity is the saltiness or dissolved salt content of a body of water (see also soil salinity).Salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the chemistryof natural waters and of biological processes within it, and is a thermodynamic state variable that, along with temperature and pressure, governs physical characteristics like the density and heat capacity of the water. A contour line of constant salinity is called an isohaline â€“ or sometimes isohale.

class
A golf course is the grounds where the game of golf is played. It comprises a series of holes, each consisting of a teeing ground, a fairway, the and other hazards, and a green with a flagstick (\"pin\") and hole (\"cup\"). A standard round of golf consists of eighteen holes. Most courses contain eighteen holes; some share fairways or greens, and a subset has nine holes, played twice per round. Par-3 courses consist of nine or eighteen holes all of which have a par of three strokes. Many older courses are links, often coastal. Courses are private, public, and municipally owned, and typically feature a pro shop. Many private courses are found at country clubs.

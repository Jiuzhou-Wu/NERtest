Transportation in Pakistan (Urdu: پاکِستان نقل و حمل) is extensive and varied and serving a population of over 191 million people. Construction of new airports, roads, and railway lines have led to an employment boost in the country. Much of Pakistan's rail network railway was built before 1947, mainly during the British Raj. In recent years, new national highways have been built, with the addition of motorways which have accelerated trade and logistics within the country. Airports and seaports have been built in the last 30 years with the addition of foreign and domestic funding.

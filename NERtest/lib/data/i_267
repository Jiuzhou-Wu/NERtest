The North Melbourne Football Club, nicknamed the Kangaroos or less formally the Roos, the Kangas or North, is the fourth oldest Australian rules football club in the Australian Football League (AFL) and is one of the oldest sporting clubs in Australia and the world. It is based at the Arden Street Oval in the inner Melbourne suburb of North Melbourne, but plays its home matches at the nearby Docklands Stadium. The club's mascot is a grey or red kangaroo, and its use dates from the middle of the 20th century. The club is also unofficially known as 'The Shinboners', a term which dates back to its 19th-century abattoir-worker origins. The club's motto is Victoria amat curam, Latin for \"Victory Demands Dedication\".

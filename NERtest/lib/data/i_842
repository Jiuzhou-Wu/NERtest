instance
Phenothiazine abbreviated PTZ is an organic compound that has the formula S(C6H4)2NH and is related to the thiazine-class of heterocyclic compounds. It is used in chemical manufacturing as a stabilizer or inhibitor. It was used in the mid-20th century as an insecticide and antihelminthic for livestock and humans, but was superseded by other compounds. Derivatives of phenothiazine discovered in the 1940s revolutionized the field of psychiatry and allergy treatment. The earliest derivative, methylene blue, was one of the first antimalarial drugs, and as of 2015 derivatives are under investigation as possible anti-infective drugs. It is a prototypical pharmaceutical lead structure in modern medicinal chemistry.

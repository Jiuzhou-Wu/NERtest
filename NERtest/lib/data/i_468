The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) (Tagalog: Hukbong Sandatahan ng Pilipinas; Spanish: Fuerzas Armadas de las Filipinas) is composed of the Philippine Army, Philippine Navy, Philippine Air Force and the Philippine Marine Corps. In 2012, a senior AFP officer reported its manpower strength to be 125,000, of which 85,000 were in the Army and the rest in the Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force. This figure matches closely with the IISS 2011 figure of 86,000 (Army), 24,000 (Navy and Marine Corps), and 15,000 (Air Force). In 2012, the AFP Chief of Staff said that there had been no increase in the number of soldiers over a long period, and that the military aims to hire 20,000 troops in three-years. In 2011 the IISS listed reserves as 100,000 Army, 15,000 Navy and Marine Corps, and 16,000 Air Force. Military service is entirely voluntary.

Pope Celestine V (Latin: Caelestinus V; 1215 â€“ 19 May 1296), born Pietro Angelerio (according to some sources Angelario, Angelieri, Angelliero, or Angeleri), also known as Pietro da Morrone and Peter of Morrone, was Pope for five months from 5 July to 13 December 1294, when he resigned. He was also a monk and hermit who founded the order of the Celestines. He was elected Pope in the Catholic Church's last non-conclave papal election ending a two-year impasse. Among the only surviving edicts he issued was the confirmation of the right of the Pope to abdicate; nearly all of his other official acts were annulled by his successor, Boniface VIII. A week after issuing the decree, Celestine resigned, stating his desire to return to his humble, pre-papal life. On 13 December 1294, Celestine announced his resignation. Celestine V was subsequently imprisoned by Pope Boniface VIII in the castle of Fumone in the Campagna region, where he died on 19 May 1296 at the age of 81. In 1313, Celestine V was canonized. No subsequent Pope has taken the name \"Celestine\".

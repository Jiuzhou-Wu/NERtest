instance
Pope Gregory III (Latin: Gregorius III; died 28 November 741) was Pope from 11 February 731 to his death in 741. His pontificate, like that of his predecessor, was disturbed by the iconoclastic controversy in the Byzantine Empire, and by the ongoing advance of the Lombards, in which he invoked the intervention of Charles Martel, although ultimately in vain. He was the last Pope born outside of Europe until the election of Pope Francis in 2013, which was 1,272 years later. He is also the only arabic Pope since the formation of the Umayyad Caliphate.

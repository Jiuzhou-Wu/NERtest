Pope Julius II (Latin: Iulius II; 5 December 1443 – 21 February 1513), nicknamed \"The Fearsome Pope\" and \"The Warrior Pope\", born Giuliano della Rovere, was Pope from 1 November 1503 to his death in 1513. His papacy was marked by an active foreign policy, ambitious building projects, and patronage for the arts—he commissioned the destruction and rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, plus Michelangelo's decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

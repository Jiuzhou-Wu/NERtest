Matthew \"Matt\" F. Hale (born July 27, 1971) is a white supremacist leader and convicted felon. Hale was the founder of the East Peoria, Illinois-based neo-Nazi group formerly known as the World Church of the Creator (now called the Creativity Movement). In 1996, Hale declared himself the third Pontifex Maximus (Latin for \"highest priest\") of the Creativity religion. In 1998, Hale was barred from practicing law in Illinois by the state panel that evaluates the character and fitness of prospective lawyers. The panel stated that Hale's incitement of racial hatred, for the ultimate purpose of depriving selected groups of their legal rights, was blatantly immoral and rendered him unfit to be a lawyer. On April 6, 2005, Hale was sentenced to a 40-year prison term for soliciting an undercover FBI informant to kill federal judge Joan Lefkow. He is currently incarcerated in the Administrative Maximum facility in Florence, Colorado, with the inmate number 15177-424. His projected release date is in 2037.

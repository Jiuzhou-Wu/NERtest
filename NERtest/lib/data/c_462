A fantasy sport (also known less commonly as rotisserie or roto) is a type of online game where participants assemble imaginary or virtual teams of real players of a professional sport. These teams compete based on the statistical performance of those players' players in actual games. This performance is converted into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by each fantasy team's manager. These point systems can be simple enough to be manually calculated by a \"league commissioner\" who coordinates and manages the overall league, or points can be compiled and calculated using computers tracking actual results of the professional sport. In fantasy sports, team owners draft, trade and cut (drop) players, analogously to real sports. Online fantasy sports are a multibillion-dollar industry, and fantasy NFL football is by far the most popular fantasy sport. Simulation games such as Strat-O-Matic are not considered fantasy sport, because they are not scored using real results of actual sporting events.

The Persian Gulf (Persian:خلیج فارس Khalīj-e Fārs) is a mediterranean sea in Western Asia. An extension of the Indian Ocean (Gulf of Oman) through the Strait of Hormuz, it lies between Iran to the northeast and the Arabian Peninsula to the southwest. The Shatt al-Arab river delta forms the northwest shoreline. The Persian Gulf was a battlefield of the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War, in which each side attacked the other's oil tankers. It is the namesake of the 1991 Gulf War, the largely air- and land-based conflict that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The gulf has many fishing grounds, extensive coral reefs, and abundant pearl oysters, but its ecology has been damaged by industrialization and oil spills. The body of water is historically and internationally known as the \"Persian Gulf\". Some Arab governments refer to it as the \"Arabian Gulf\" or \"The Gulf\", but neither term is recognized internationally. The name \"Gulf of Iran (Persian Gulf)\" is used by the International Hydrographic Organization.

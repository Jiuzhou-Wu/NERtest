Euphorion (mythology)
instance
In Greek mythology, Euphorion (Greek: ¦¥?¦Õ¦Ï¦Ñ?¦Ø¦Í, \"the abundant\") was the son of Achilles and Helen. He was born when his parents had already been dwelling in the Land of the Blessed, and was named \"after the fertility of the land\". He had a pair of wings. For unknown reasons, Euphorion became the object of Zeus' wrath. Zeus caught him on the island of Milos and killed him with a thunderbolt. He further prohibited to bury Euphorion; the island nymphs did bury him nevertheless and were changed into frogs for having disobeyed Zeus.

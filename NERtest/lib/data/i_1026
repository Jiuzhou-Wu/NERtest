During his reign the Roman eastern frontier underwent extensive re-fortification, including the construction of Dara, a stronghold intended to counter the Persian fortress of Nisibis. During his reign, one of the most fortified castle cities on the Adriatic, Durrës Castle in Durrës, was constructed.

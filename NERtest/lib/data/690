Kansas City, Missouri
instance
Kansas City, or K.C., is the largest city, and second largest metropolitan area, in the state of Missouri. It is the 37th¨Clargest city by population in the United States and the 23rd¨Clargest by area. It is the central city of the Kansas City metropolitan area, which straddles the Kansas¨CMissouri border. It was founded in the 1830s as a Missouri River port at its confluence with the Kansas River coming in from the west. Originally called Kansas after the river, this became confusing upon the establishment of Kansas Territory in 1854. The name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish the two. Sitting on Missouri's western border, with downtown near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the modern city encompasses 316 square miles (820 km2). Most of the city is located in Jackson County, but portions of the city spill into Clay, Cass, and Platte counties. It is one of Jackson County's two county seats (the other being Independence). The 18th and Vine Neighborhood gave birth to the musical styles of Kansas City jazz and Kansas City blues. It is also known for Kansas City-style barbecue. The area is infamous for the Border War that occurred during the American Civil War, including the Battle of Westport and Bleeding Kansas. Major suburbs include the Missouri cities of Independence and Lee's Summit and the Kansas cities of Overland Park, Olathe, and Kansas City.

Nasjonal Samling ([nɑʃuˈnɑːl ˈsɑmlɪŋ], National Unity), abbreviated NS, was a Norwegian fascist party active from 1933 to 1945. Founded by former minister of defence Vidkun Quisling and a group of supporters such as Johan Bernhard Hjort – who led the party's paramilitary wing (Hirden) for a short time before leaving the party in 1937 after various internal conflicts. The party celebrated its founding on 17 May, Norway's national holiday, but was founded on 13 May 1933.

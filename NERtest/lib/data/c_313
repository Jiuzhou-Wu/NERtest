class
Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a future setting, noted for its focus on \"high tech and low life\" aspects of society. It features advanced technology and science, such as information technology and cybernetics, coupled with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order. Cyberpunk plots often center on a conflict among artificial intelligences, and megacorporations, and tend to be set in a future Earth, rather than the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as Isaac Asimov's Foundation or Frank Herbert's Dune. The settings are usually post-industrial dystopias but tend to be marked by extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its creators (\"the street finds its own uses for things\"). Much of the genre's atmosphere echoes film noir, and written works in the genre often use techniques from detective fiction.

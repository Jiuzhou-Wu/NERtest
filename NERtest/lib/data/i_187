
No wave
instance
No wave was a short-lived avant-garde music, performance art, video art and contemporary art scene that had its beginnings during the late 1970s in downtown New York City. In part a reaction against punk rock's recycling of traditionalist rock tropes, no wave musicians instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to a variety of non-rock genres. The no wave scene often reflected an abrasive, confrontational and nihilistic worldview. The term \"no wave\" was a pun based on the rejection of commercial new wave music, and first became used in downtown New York City concurrent with the 1981 show, \"New York/New Wave\" that had been curated by the artist/curator Diego Cortez. The term \"no wave\" was probably inspired by the French New Wave pioneer Jean-Luc Godard, with his remark \"There are no new waves, there is only the ocean\". The movement would last a relatively short time but profoundly influence the development of independent film, fashion and visual art.

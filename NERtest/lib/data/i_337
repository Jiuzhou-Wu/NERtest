
Official Monster Raving Loony Party
instance
The Official Monster Raving Loony Party is a registered political party established in the United Kingdom in 1983 by the musician David Sutch (1940â€“1999), better known as \"Screaming Lord Sutch, 3rd Earl of Harrow\" or simply \"Screaming Lord Sutch\". It is notable for its deliberately bizarre policies and it effectively exists to satirise British politics, and to offer itself as an poignant alternative for protest voters, especially in constituencies where the party holding the seat is unlikely to lose it and everyone else's vote would be quietly wasted.

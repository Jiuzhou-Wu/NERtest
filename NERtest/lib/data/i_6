Michael Alexander Kirkwood Halliday (often M. A. K. Halliday; born 13 April 1925) is a British-born Australian linguist who developed the internationally influential systemic functional linguistic model of language. His grammatical descriptions go by the name of systemic functional grammar (SFG). Halliday describes language as a semiotic system, \"not in the sense of a system of signs, but a systemic resource for meaning\". For Halliday, language is a \"meaning potential\"; by extension, he defines linguistics as the study of \"how people exchange meanings by 'languaging'\". Halliday describes himself as a generalist, meaning that he has tried \"to look at language from every possible vantage point\", and has described his work as \"wander[ing] the highways and byways of language\". However, he has claimed that \"to the extent that I favoured any one angle, it was the social: language as the creature and creator of human society\".

instance
Rehoboam (pronounced /ˌriːəˈboʊ.əm/; Hebrew: רְחַבְעָם, Reẖav'am, Rəḥaḇʻām ; meaning \"he who enlarges the people\"; Greek: Ροβοαμ; Latin: Roboam) was an Israelite king mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, for whose existence there is so far no direct extra-biblical proof. According to I Kings and II Chronicles, he was initially king of the United Monarchy of Israel, but after the ten northern tribes of Israel rebelled in 932/931 BC to form the independent Kingdom of Israel, he remained as king of only the Kingdom of Judah, or southern kingdom. He was a son of Solomon and a grandson of David. His mother was Naamah the Ammonite. One episode which the Bible places during the reign of Rehoboam, and which is confirmed by the records from the Bubastite Portal in Karnak and other archaeological find—without the specific mention of the name Rehoboam—is the Egyptian invasion of Palestine by the Egyptian pharaoh Shoshenq I, who is identified by many with the biblical King Shishak. One of the most difficult issues in identifying Shishak with Shoshenq II is the biblical statement that \"King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. He seized the treasures of the Lord's temple and the royal palace\" (1 Kings 14:25-26), making this Shoshenq's biggest prize, whereas the Bubastite Portal lists do not include Jerusalem or any city from central Judea among the surviving names in the list of Shoshenq's conquests.

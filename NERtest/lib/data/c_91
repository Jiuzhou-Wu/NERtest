class
Patriotism is an emotional attachment to a nation which an individual recognizes as their homeland. This attachment, also known as national feeling or national pride, can be viewed in terms of different features relating to one's own nation, including ethnic, cultural, political or historical aspects. It encompasses a set of concepts closely related to those of nationalism. An excess of patriotism in the defense of a nation is called chauvinism; another related term is jingoism. The English term patriot is first attested in the Elizabethan era, via Middle French from Late Latin (6th century) patriota, meaning \"countryman\", ultimately from Greek πατριώτης (patriōtēs), meaning \"from the same country\", from πατρίς (patris), meaning \"fatherland\". The abstract noun patriotism appears in the early 18th century.

Richard E. Wagner (born April 28, 1941) is a professor of economics at George Mason University. He works primarily in the fields of public finance and public choice. Wagner received his doctorate in economics from the University of Virginia, studying under James M. Buchanan. Wagner's work centers on the notion that macroeconomic phenomena are emergent, rather than being objects of choice. In addition to Buchanan, major influences on his thought include Carl Menger, Thomas Schelling, and scholars of the Italian school of public finance.

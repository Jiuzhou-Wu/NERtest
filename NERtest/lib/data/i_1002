Richard Bedford Bennett, 1st Viscount Bennett, PC KC (3 July 1870 – 26 June 1947) was a Canadian lawyer, businessman, politician, and philanthropist. He served as the 11th Prime Minister of Canada from 7 August 1930 to 23 October 1935, during the worst of the Great Depression years. Following his defeat as prime minister, Bennett moved to England, and was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Bennett. Most historians consider his premiership to have been a failure at a time of severe economic crisis. Blair Neatby says categorically that \"as a politician he was a failure\". J. L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer, comparing him to all other Canadian prime ministers concluded, \"Bennett utterly failed as a leader. Everyone was alienated by the end—Cabinet, caucus, party, voter and foreigner.\"

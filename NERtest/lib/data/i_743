instance
Pope Victor I (died 199) was a bishop of Rome, and hence a pope, in the late second century. The dates of his tenure are uncertain, but one source states he became pope in 189 and gives the year of his death as 199. He was the first bishop of Rome born in the Roman Province of Africaâ€”probably in Leptis Magna (or Tripolitania). He was later considered a saint. His feast day is celebrated on 28 July as \"St Victor I, Pope and Martyr\".

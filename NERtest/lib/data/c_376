
Cola
class
Cola is a sweetened, carbonated soft drink, derived from drinks that originally contained caffeine from the kola nut and cocaine from coca leaves, flavored with vanilla and other ingredients. Most colas now use other flavoring (and caffeinating) ingredients with a similar taste. Colas became popular worldwide after pharmacist John Pemberton invented Coca-Cola in 1886. His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the coca wine of pharmacist Angelo Mariani, created in 1863. Modern colas usually contain caramel color, caffeine and sweeteners such as sugar or high fructose corn syrup.

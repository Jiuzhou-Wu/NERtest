instance
Neopets (originally NeoPets) is a virtual pet website. Visitors can create accounts, own virtual pets (\"Neopets\"), and buy virtual items for them using one of two virtual currencies, one of which can be earned within the site and the other of which can purchased with real-world money. The website was launched by Adam Powell and Donna Williams in late 1999. Two years later, a consortium of investors led by Doug Dohring bought a controlling interest in the company and in June 2005, Viacom bought Neopets Inc. for US$160 million. On March 17, 2014, Neopets was sold to Knowledge Adventure for an unannounced amount.

A Wizard of Earthsea is a young-adult fantasy novel written by the American author Ursula K. Le Guin, first published by the small press Parnassus in 1968. Set in the fictional archipelago of Earthsea, the story follows the education of a young mage named Ged who joins the school of wizardry. A Wizard of Earthsea is widely regarded as a classic of fantasy and young-adult literature and was one of the final recipients of the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, an award that recognized outstanding children's literature. Le Guin would later write five subsequent books that, together with A Wizard of Earthsea, are referred to as the Earthsea Cycle: The Tombs of Atuan (1971), The Farthest Shore (1972), Tehanu (1990), The Other Wind (2001), and Tales from Earthsea (2001). Margaret Atwood has called A Wizard of Earthsea one of the \"wellsprings\" of fantasy literature, illustrating Le Guin's influence within the genre. A Wizard of Earthsea has been compared to major fantasy works such as J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Modern writers have credited A Wizard of Earthsea for introducing the idea of a \"wizard school,\" which would later be made famous by the Harry Potter series of books.

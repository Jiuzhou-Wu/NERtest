The Aegean Sea (/??d?i??n/; Greek: ¦¡¦É¦Ã¦Á?¦Ï ¦°?¦Ë¦Á¦Ã¦Ï? [e??eo ?pela?os]; Turkish: Ege Denizi [e??e? de?n?iz?i]) is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea located between the Greek and Anatolian peninsulas, i.e., between the mainlands of Greece and Turkey. In the north, it is connected to the Marmara Sea and Black Sea by the Dardanelles and Bosporus. The Aegean Islands are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes. The sea was traditionally known as Archipelago (in Greek, ¦¡¦Ñ¦Ö¦É¦Ð?¦Ë¦Á¦Ã¦Ï?, meaning \"chief sea\"), but in English this word's meaning has changed to refer to the Aegean Islands and, generally, to any island group.

The Natural Law Party (NLP) was a transnational party founded in 1992 on \"the principles of Transcendental Meditation\", the laws of nature, and their application to all levels of government. It was active in up to 74 countries. It continues in India and some parts of the United States. The party defined \"natural law\" as the organizing intelligence which governs the natural universe. The Natural Law Party advocated using the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi program as tools to enliven natural law and reduce or eliminate problems in society. Prominent candidates included John Hagelin for U.S. president and Doug Henning as representative of Rosedale, Toronto, Canada. George Harrison performed a benefit concert in support of the party in 1992. Electoral success was achieved by the Ajeya Bharat Party in India, which elected a legislator to the state assembly, and the Croatian NLP, which elected a member of their regional assembly in 1993. In the USA its organization was reported to rival that of other \"established third parties\".

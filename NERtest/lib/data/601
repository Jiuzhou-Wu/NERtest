President
class
A president is the leader of a country or a division or part of a country, typically a republic, a democracy, or a dictatorship. The title \"president\" is sometimes used by extension for leaders of other groups, including corporate entities. Etymologically, a president is one who presides (from Latin prae- \"before\" + sedere \"to sit\"; giving the term praeses). Originally, the term referred to the presiding officer of a ceremony or meeting (i.e., chairman), but today it most commonly refers to an executive official. Among other things, \"President\" today is a common title for the heads of state of most republics, whether presidential republics, semi-presidential republics or parliamentary republics.

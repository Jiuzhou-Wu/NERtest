Naomi R. Wolf (born November 12, 1962) is an American author, journalist and former political advisor to Al Gore and Bill Clinton. Wolf first came to prominence in 1991 as the author of The Beauty Myth, in which she postulated that \"beauty\" as a normative value is entirely socially constructed, and that the patriarchy determines the content of that construction with the goal of reproducing its own hegemony. With the book, she became a leading spokeswoman of what was later described as the third wave of the feminist movement. The book was praised by feminist figures such as Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan, and was criticized by other feminist figures like Camille Paglia and Christina Hoff Sommers. She has since written other books, including the bestselling book The End of America in 2007 and her latest . Her journalism career began in 1995 and has included topics such as abortion, the Occupy Wall Street movement, Edward Snowden and ISIS. She has written in venues such as The Nation, The Guardian and The Huffington Post. Writers in Salon.com, National Review, Alternet, Mother Jones and The Atlantic have for some time criticized her journalism as conspiratorial and overblown.

André René Roussimoff (May 19, 1946 – January 27, 1993), known as André the Giant, was a French professional wrestler and actor. He most famously feuded with Hulk Hogan, culminating at WrestleMania III, and his best-remembered film role was that of Fezzik, the giant in The Princess Bride. His size was a result of gigantism caused by excess growth hormone, which later resulted in acromegaly. It also led to him being called \"The Eighth Wonder of the World\". In the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE), André was a WWF World Heavyweight Champion and a one-time WWF Tag Team Champion. In 1993, André was the inaugural inductee into the WWF Hall of Fame.

Beta-lactamase
instance
Beta-lactamases are enzymes (EC 3.5.2.6) produced by bacteria(Also known as Penicillinase ) that provide resistance to ¦Â-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, cephamycins, and carbapenems (ertapenem), although carbapenems are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamase provides antibiotic resistance by breaking the antibiotics' structure. These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a ¦Â-lactam. Through hydrolysis, the lactamase enzyme breaks the ¦Â-lactam ring open, deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties. Beta-lactam antibiotics are typically used to treat a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative organisms are usually secreted, especially when antibiotics are present in the environment.

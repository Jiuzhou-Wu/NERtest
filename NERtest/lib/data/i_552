Pope Adrian VI (Latin: Hadrianus VI), born Adriaan Florensz (Boeyens) (2 March 1459 â€’ 14 September 1523), was Pope of the Catholic Church from 9 January 1522 until his death on 14 September 1523. Pope Adrian VI was born in the Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht in the Netherlands and was the last non-Italian pope until Pope John Paul II from Poland became pope in 1978. Pope Adrian VI and his eventual successor Pope Marcellus II are the only popes of the modern era to retain their baptismal names after their election.

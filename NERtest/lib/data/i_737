instance
The Porsche 924 is a luxury sports car which was produced by Porsche AG of Germany from 1976 to 1988. A two-door, 2+2 coup√©, the 924 replaced the 914 as the company's entry-level model, and was the model that finally retired the 912. In production terms, the 924 was the first Porsche model powered by a water-cooled, front-mounted engine although the similarly configured 928 was designed first. The front-engine, rear wheel drive arrangement was normal for most other manufacturers, but it was unusual for Porsche having previously only used mid- or rear-mounted engines of a boxer configuration, all of which had been air-cooled. It was the first Porsche to be offered with a fully automatic transmission. The first official appearance of the 924 took place in November 1975 (as a press launch rather than a motorshow appearance) at the harbour at La Grande Motte, Camargue in the south of France. The model was a qualified success with just over 150,000 produced (from 1977-1988), and it helped to take Porsche out of financial ruin.[citation needed] The 924 was meant to be replaced by the closely related 944 in 1983 in the U.S. market, but it returned in 1986 and continued to be produced until 1988. For the 1986 to 1988 model years, the car acquired the powerplant from the 944 model and became the Porsche 924S.

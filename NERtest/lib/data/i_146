Nicanor Segundo Parra Sandoval (born 5 September 1914) is a Chilean poet, mathematician, and physicist. He is considered an influential poet in Chile and throughout Latin America. Some rank him among the most important poets of Spanish language literature. Parra describes himself as an \"anti-poet,\" due to his distaste for standard poetic pomp and function; after recitations he exclaims \"Me retracto de todo lo dicho\" (\"I take back everything I said\").

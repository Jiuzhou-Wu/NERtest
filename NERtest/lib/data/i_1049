Richard Channing Garfield (born June 26, 1963, Philadelphia) is an American game designer. Garfield created Magic: The Gathering, which is considered to be the first modern collectible card game (CCG). Magic debuted in 1993, and its success spawned many imitations. Garfield oversaw the successful growth of Magic and followed it with other game designs. Garfield also designed the CCGs Netrunner, BattleTech, Vampire: The Eternal Struggle (originally known as Jyhad), Star Wars Trading Card Game, the card game The Great Dalmuti, and the board game RoboRally. He also created a variation of the game Hearts called Complex hearts. Garfield first became passionate about games when he played the roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons, so he designed Magic decks to be customizable like roleplaying characters. Garfield and Magic are in the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame.

class
A shooting sport is a competitive sport involving tests of proficiency (accuracy and speed) using various types of guns such as firearms and airguns. Hunting is also a shooting sport, and indeed shooting live pheasants was an Olympic event (albeit only once, in 1900).[citation needed] The shooting sports are categorized by the type of firearm, targets, and distances at which the targets are shot.

instance
Nial (from \"Nested Interactive Array Language\") is a high-level array programming language developed from about 1981 by Mike Jenkins of Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Nial combines a functional programming notation for arrays based on Array Theory developed by Trenchard More with structured programming concepts for numeric, character and symbolic data. It is most often used for prototyping and artificial intelligence.

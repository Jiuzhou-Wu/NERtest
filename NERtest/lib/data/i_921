Quedlinburg ([ˈkveːdlɪnbʊʁk]) is a medieval German town situated just north of the Harz mountains, in the district of Harz in the west of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. In 1994, both the medieval court and the old town were added to the prestigious UNESCO world heritage list. The town was the capital of the county of Quedlinburg until 2007, when the district was dissolved. Several locations in the town are designated stops along the scenic holiday route, the Romanesque Road.

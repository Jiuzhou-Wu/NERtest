
Public speaking
class
Public speaking (sometimes termed oratory or oration) is the process or act of performing a presentation (a speech) focused around an individual directly speaking to a live audience in a structured, deliberate manner in order to inform, influence, or entertain them. Public speaking is commonly understood as the formal, face-to-face talking of a single person to a group of listeners. It is closely allied to \"presenting\", although the latter is more often associated with commercial activity. Most of the time, public speaking is to persuade the audience.

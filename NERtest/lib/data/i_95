The Nez Perce /ˌnɛzˈpɜːrs/ (autonym: Niimíipu) are a Native American tribe who live in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, which is on the Columbia River Plateau. An anthropological interpretation says they descended from the Old Cordilleran Culture, which moved south from the Rocky Mountains and west into lands where the tribe coalesced. The federally recognized Nez Perce Nation currently governs and lives within its reservation in Idaho. Their name for themselves is Nimíipuu (pronounced [nimiːpuː]), meaning, \"The People,\" in their language, part of the Sahaptin family. They speak the Nez Perce language or Niimiipuutímt, a Sahaptian language related to the several dialects of Sahaptin. The Sahaptian sub-family is one of the branches of the Plateau Penutian family (which in turn may be related to a larger Penutian grouping).

Tug of war (also known as war of tug, tug o' war, tug war, rope war, rope pulling, or tugging war) is a sport that directly puts two teams against each other in a test of strength: teams pull on opposite ends of a rope, with the goal being to bring the rope a certain distance in one direction against the force of the opposing team's pull.

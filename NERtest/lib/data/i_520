instance
Linus (died c. AD 76) was, according to several early sources, the second Bishop of Rome, and is listed by the Roman Catholic church as the second pope. His papacy lasted from c. AD 67 to his death. According to other early sources, Pope Clement I was the second pope; according to the Catholic Church's Annuario Pontificio, however, Clement I was the fourth pope. Among those believed by the Catholic Church to have held the position of pope, only Clement, Linus and Peter are specifically mentioned in the New Testament.

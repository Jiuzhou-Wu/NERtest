instance
Salvador de Vives Rodó (1784–1845) was a Puerto Rican politician and Mayor of Ponce, Puerto Rico from 1840 to 1842 and then again from 1844 to 1845. He was the son of Quirse Vives and Ana Maria Rodo. He was a wealthy coffee plantation owner who established the now historic Hacienda Buena Vista. Under de Vives' administration as mayor, the now historic Ponce City Hall was built. De Vives trusted the design of City Hall to prominent architect Francisco Gil Capó. The trees in Plaza Las Delicias are due to De Vives' direction.

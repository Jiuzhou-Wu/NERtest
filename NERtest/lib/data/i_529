Pope Alexander III (c. 1100/1105 â€“ 30 August 1181), born Roland of Siena, was Pope from 7 September 1159 to his death in 1181. Through the Papal bull Manifestis Probatum, issued on May 23, 1179, he recognized the right of Afonso I to proclaim himself King of Portugal, thus recognizing Portugal as an independent and sovereign Kingdom. He also laid the foundation stone for the Notre-Dame de Paris.

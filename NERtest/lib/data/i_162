Nag Hammadi (Arabic: نجع حمادى, [ˈnæɡʕe ħæmˈmæːdi]) is a city in Upper Egypt. Nag Hammadi was known as Chenoboskion (Greek: Χηνοβόσκιον) in classical antiquity,[citation needed] meaning \"geese grazing grounds\". It is located on the west bank of the Nile in the Qena Governorate, about 80 kilometres north-west of Luxor. It has a population of about 30,000, who are mostly farmers. Sugar and aluminium are produced in Nag Hammadi. Egyptalum is the largest aluminium producer in the Middle East. Wood particleboard is manufactured from sugar cane bagasse. The town of Nag Hammadi was established by Mahmoud Pasha Hammadi, who was a member of the Hammadi family in Sohag, Egypt. Mahmoud Pasha Hammadi was a major landholder in Sohag, and known for his strong opposition to the British occupation. Mahmoud Pasha Hammadi created Nag Hammadi for the indigenous people from Sohag who were forced to abandon their homeland by the British occupation. In recognition of this, the new town was given the name \"Hammadi\".[citation needed]

class
A chef is a person who is a highly trained, skilled professional cook who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation of a particular cuisine. The word \"chef\" is derived (and shortened) from the term chef de cuisine ([??f.d?.k?i.zin]), the director or head of a kitchen. Chefs can receive both formal training from an institution, as well as serving time as an apprentice under an experienced chef. There are different terms which use the word chef in their titles, and deal with specific areas of food preparation, such as the Sous-chef who acts as the second-in-command in a kitchen, or the Chef de partie who handles a specific area of production. The Brigade system is a system of hierarchy found in restaurants and hotels employing extensive staff, many of which use the word chef in their titles. Underneath the chefs are the kitchen assistants. A chef's standard uniform for a chef includes a hat called a toque, necktie, double-breasted jacket, apron and shoes with steel or plastic toe-caps.

The Archdiocese of Armagh (Latin: Archidioecesis Ardmachana; Irish: Ard-Deoise Ard Mhacha) is a Roman Catholic archdiocese in the northern part of Ireland. The Ordinary is the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh who is also the Metropolitan of the Ecclesiastical province of Armagh and the Primate of All Ireland. The mother church is St Patrick's Cathedral. The claims of the archdiocese to pre-eminence in Ireland as the primatial see, rests upon its traditional establishment by Saint Patrick circa 445. It was formally recognised as a metropolitan province in 1152 by the Synod of Kells. As of September 2014 the incumbent Archbishop is Eamon Martin.

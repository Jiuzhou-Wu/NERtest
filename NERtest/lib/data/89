Baronet
class
A baronet (/b?r?n?t/ or /b?r?n?t/; abbreviated \"Bart\" or \"Bt\") or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (/b?r??n?t?s/; abbreviation \"Btss\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 in order to raise funds. A baronetcy is the only British hereditary honour which is not a peerage, with the exception of the Anglo-Irish Black Knight, White Knight and Green Knight (of which only The Green Knight is still extant). A baronet is addressed as \"Sir\", the same as a knight (or \"Dame\" for a baronetess), but ranks above all knighthoods and damehoods in the Order of precedence, except for the Order of the Garter and the Order of the Thistle (and the defunct Order of St Patrick). Baronets are not formally deemed to be noble, although they are widely regarded as being members of the aristocracy. In Europe their social rank is roughly equivalent to petite noblesse.

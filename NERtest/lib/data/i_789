Aquarius is a constellation of the zodiac, situated between Capricornus and Pisces. Its name is Latin for \"water-carrier\" or \"cup-carrier\", and its symbol is (Unicode â™’), a representation of water. Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac (the sun's apparent path). It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is found in a region often called the Sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as Cetus the whale, Pisces the fish, and Eridanus the river.

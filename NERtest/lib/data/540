Pudendal nerve
instance
The pudendal nerve is the main nerve of the perineum.:274 It carries sensation from the external genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the anus and perineum, as well the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the male or female external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter. If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, lesions may cause sensory loss or fecal incontinence. The nerve may also be temporarily blocked as part of an anaesthetic procedure. The pudendal canal is also known by the eponymous term \"Alcock's canal\", after Benjamin Alcock, an Irish anatomist who documented the canal in 1836.

instance
Noah Webster, Jr. (October 16, 1758 â€“ May 28, 1843), was an American lexicographer, textbook pioneer, English-language spelling reformer, political writer, editor, and prolific author. He has been called the \"Father of American Scholarship and Education\". His blue-backed speller books taught five generations of American children how to spell and read, secularizing their education. According to Ellis (1979) he gave Americans \"a secular catechism to the nation-state.\" Webster's name has become synonymous with \"dictionary\" in the United States, especially the modern Merriam-Webster dictionary that was first published in 1828 as An American Dictionary of the English Language

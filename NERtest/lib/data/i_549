Pope Adrian IV (Latin: Adrianus IV; c. 1100 – 1 September 1159), born Nicholas Breakspear, was pope from 4 December 1154 to his death in 1159. Adrian IV is the only Englishman (as of 2016) to have occupied the papal throne. It is believed that he was born in Bedmond in the parish of Abbots Langley in Hertfordshire and received his early education at the Abbey School, St Albans.

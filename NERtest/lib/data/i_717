The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) (Arabic: منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية; About this sound Munaẓẓamat at-Taḥrīr al-Filasṭīniyyah ) is an organization founded in 1964 with the purpose of the \"liberation of Palestine\" through armed struggle. It is recognized as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people\" by over 100 states with which it holds diplomatic relations, and has enjoyed observer status at the United Nations since 1974. The PLO was considered by the United States and Israel to be a terrorist organization until the Madrid Conference in 1991. In 1993, the PLO recognized Israel's right to exist in peace, accepted UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, and rejected \"violence and terrorism\"; in response, Israel officially recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.

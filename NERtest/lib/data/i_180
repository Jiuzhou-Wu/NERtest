The National Cartoonists Society (NCS) is an organization of professional cartoonists in the United States. It presents the National Cartoonists Society Awards. The Society was born in 1946 when groups of cartoonists got together to entertain the troops. They enjoyed each other's company and decided to meet on a regular basis. NCS members work in many branches of the profession, including advertising, animation, newspaper comic strips and syndicated single-panel cartoons, comic books, editorial cartoons, gag cartoons, graphic novels, greeting cards, magazine and book illustration. Only recently has the National Cartoonists Society embraced web comics. Membership is limited to established professional cartoonists, with a few exceptions of outstanding persons in affiliated fields. The NCS is not a guild or labor union. The organization's stated primary purposes are \"to advance the ideals and standards of professional cartooning in its many forms\", \"to promote and foster a social, cultural and intellectual interchange among professional cartoonists of all types\" and \"to stimulate and encourage interest in and acceptance of the art of cartooning by aspiring cartoonists, students and the general public.\"

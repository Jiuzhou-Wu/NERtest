They have played in League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system, since the 2011–12 season. They are one of two teams in Devon currently competing in the Football League, the other being Exeter City.

The team set the record for most championships won in the third tier, having finished first in the Third Division South twice, the Third Division once and the Second Division once. The club takes its nickname, \"The Pilgrims\", from an English religious group that left Plymouth for the New World in 1620. The club crest features the Mayflower, the ship that carried the pilgrims to Massachusetts. The city of Plymouth is the largest in England never to have hosted top-flight football. They are the most southerly and westerly League club in England.

class
In contemporary business and science a project is a collaborative enterprise, involving research or design, that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim. Project can also be defined as a set of interrelated tasks to be executed over a fixed period and within certain cost and other limitations. Projects can be further defined as temporary rather than permanent social systems or work systems that are constituted by teams within or across organizations to accomplish particular tasks under time constraints. An ongoing project is usually called (or evolves into) a program.

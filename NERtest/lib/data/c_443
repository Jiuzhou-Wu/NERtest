class
A school voucher, also called an education voucher, in a voucher system, is a certificate of government funding for a student at a school chosen by the student or the student's parents. The funding is usually for a particular year, term or semester.[citation needed] In some countries, states or local jurisdictions, the voucher can be used to cover or reimburse home schooling expenses.[citation needed] In some countries, vouchers only exist for tuition at private schools.[citation needed] Under many non-voucher education systems, people who pay for private schooling are still taxed for public schools, these parents fund both public schools (through taxes) and private schools (through tuition) simultaneously; although, in some countries, states or local jurisdictions (e.g. in Australia) private schools may still receive substantial government funding.

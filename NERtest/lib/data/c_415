
Dragoon
class
The word dragoon originally meant mounted infantry, who were trained in horse riding as well as infantry fighting skills. However, usage altered over time and during the 18th century, dragoons evolved into conventional cavalry units. In most armies, \"dragoons\" came to signify ordinary medium cavalry. Dragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The name is derived from a type of firearm (called a dragon) carried by dragoons of the French Army. The title has been retained in modern times by a number of armoured or ceremonial mounted regiments.


Flying car (aircraft)
class
A flying car is a personal vehicle that provides door-to-door aerial transportation. Fulfillment of some of these goals is being attempted by personal air vehicles being developed. The term \"flying car\" has also been used to refer to roadable aircraft and hovercars. The flying car has been depicted in works of fantasy and science fiction such as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, The Jetsons, Star Wars, Blade Runner, The Fifth Element and the first two Back to the Future films as well as in technology magazines such as Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, and Mechanix Illustrated. The flying car was and remains a common feature of science fiction and conceptions of the future, including imagined near futures such as those of the 21st century. As an example, less than a month before the turn of the millennium the U.S. journalist Gail Collins noted: As a result, flying cars have also been referred to jokingly with the question \"Where's my flying car?\", emblematic of the supposed failure of modern technology to match futuristic visions that were promoted in earlier decades.


Cookie
class
A cookie is a small, flat, sweet, baked good, usually containing flour, eggs, sugar, and either butter, cooking oil or another oil or fat. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips or nuts. In most English-speaking countries except for the US and Canada, crisp cookies are called biscuits. Chewier cookies are commonly called cookies even in the UK. Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars. Cookies may be mass-produced in factories, made in small bakeries or home-made. Cookie variants include sandwich cookies, which are using two thin cookies with a filling of creme (e.g., Oreos), marshmallow or jam and dipping the cookie in chocolate or another sweet coating. Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea. Factory-made cookies are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores and vending machines. Fresh-baked cookies are sold at bakeries and coffeehouses, with the latter ranging from small business-sized establishments to multinational corporations such as Starbucks.

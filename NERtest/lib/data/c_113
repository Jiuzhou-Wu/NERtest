
Quango
class
In both the United Kingdom and Ireland, a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation (quango or QuANGO, less often QANGO or qango) is an organisation to which a government has devolved power. In the United Kingdom this term covers different \"arm's-length\" government bodies, including \"non-departmental public bodies\", non-ministerial departments, and executive agencies. The Forestry Commission, which is a non-ministerial government department responsible for forestry in England and Scotland, is an example of a quango.

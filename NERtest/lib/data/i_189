Nazareth (/ˈnæzərəθ/; Hebrew: נָצְרַת, Naṣrat; Aramaic: ܢܨܪܬ, Naṣrath; Arabic: النَّاصِرَة, an-Nāṣira) is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as \"the Arab capital of Israel\". The population is made up predominantly of Israeli Arabs, almost all of whom are either Muslim (69%) or Christian (30.9%). Nazareth Illit (lit. \"Upper Nazareth\") is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974. In the New Testament, the city is described as the childhood home of Jesus, and as such is a center of Christian pilgrimage, with many shrines commemorating biblical events.

The Republic of Texas (Spanish: República de Texas) was an independent sovereign country in North America that existed from March 2, 1836, to February 19, 1846. It was bordered by the nation of Mexico to the west and southwest, the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast, the two U.S. states of Louisiana and Arkansas to the east and northeast, and United States territories encompassing the current U.S. states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming to the north. The citizens of the republic were known as Texians. The republic was formed as a separate nation after gaining independence from Mexico in 1836. It claimed borders that included all of the present U.S. state of Texas and also parts of present-day Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico, based upon the Treaties of Velasco between the newly-created Texas Republic and Mexico. The eastern boundary with the United States was defined by the Adams–Onís Treaty between the United States and Spain in 1819. The republic's southern- and western-most boundary with Mexico was under dispute throughout the republic's entire existence. Texas claimed the boundary as the Rio Grande (a.k.a. Río Bravo/Río Bravo del Norte), while Mexico claimed the boundary as the Nueces River. This dispute would later become a trigger for the Mexican–American War of 1846–48. The republic's independence ended with Texas's annexation by the U.S. on December 29, 1845.

The Dutch Open Tennis Amersfoort (or Dutch Open) was a men's tennis tournament played on outdoor clay court and held in three different locations in The Netherlands between 1957 and 2008. From the inaugural edition in 1957 until 1994 the tournament was played in Hilversum at \"'t Melkhuisje\". It was part of the Grand Prix tennis circuit in the 1970s and an ATP Tour event from its inception in 1990. Amsterdam became the event host in 1995 and in 2002 the tournament moved to Amersfoort where it was held until its final edition in 2008. In 2008 the organizers sold the right of organization to the family of Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic, and the tournament was moved to Belgrade, where it became known as the Serbia Open. Bal¨¢zs Tar¨®czy won six editions and is the record title holder.

instance
Nu metal (also known as n√º-metal and aggro-metal) is a form of alternative metal that combines elements of heavy metal music with elements of other music genres such as hip hop, alternative rock, funk and grunge. Nu metal bands have drawn elements and influences from a variety of musical styles, including multiple genres of heavy metal. Nu metal rarely features guitar solos; it is heavily syncopated and based on guitar riffs. Many nu metal guitarists use seven-string guitars that are down-tuned to play a heavier sound. DJs are occasionally featured in nu metal to provide instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds. Vocal styles in nu metal include singing, rapping, screaming and growling. At the time of the release of Korn's 1996 album Life is Peachy, the popularity of nu metal was beginning to grow, and broke into the mainsteam in 1998. In the late 1990s, some bands were blending nu metal with other music genres. For example, industrial metal elements were incorporated into the music of Static-X and Dope. In 2003, MTV wrote that nu metal's popularity was declining, but nu metal still had mainstream success. During the mid-2000s, nu metal lost popularity and metalcore became one of the most popular genres within the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. During this period, classic rock-inspired bands and emo bands grew in popularity and exceeded the declining popularity of nu metal. Also, during this period, many nu metal bands experimented with other styles of music, or in some cases, changed their style altogether. Nu metal is one of the key genres of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.

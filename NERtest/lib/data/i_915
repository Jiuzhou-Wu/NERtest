Quechuan /ˈkɛtʃwən/, also known as runa simi (\"people's language\"), is a Native American language family spoken primarily in the Andes region of South America. Derived from a common ancestral language, it is the most widely spoken language family of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, with a total of probably some 8 million to 10 million speakers. It is perhaps most widely known for being the main language of the Inca Empire.

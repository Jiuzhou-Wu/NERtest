instance
The Cummins B Series is a family of American straight-four and straight-6 diesel truck and industrial piston engines that are manufactured by Cummins. The B Series is known for the popular 3.9 liters (238.0 cu in) straight-four and 5.9 liters (360.0 cu in) straight-six motors. A 3.3 liters (201.4 cu in) straight-four is also available. The B Series is widely used in many segments, including pickup trucks (the Dodge Ram), buses, military vehicles, construction equipment, and marine vehicles. Some of the construction and marine applications use a dual installation, of two B Series Cummins engines. The engine was originally designed by Cummins and Case Corporation for commercial truck applications, and gained much of its popularity after appearing in the Dodge Ram, in 1989.

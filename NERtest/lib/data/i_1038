
Regiomontanus
instance
Johannes Müller von Königsberg (6 June 1436 – 6 July 1476), today best known by the Latin epithet Regiomontanus, was a German mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, translator, instrument maker and Catholic bishop. He was born in the Franconian village of Unfinden, now part of Königsberg, Bavaria — not in the more famous East-Prussian Königsberg. He was also known as Johannes der Königsberger (Johannes of Königsberg). His writings were published under the name of Ioannes de Monte Regio, a Latinized version of his name. Both names mean \"John of King's Mountain\". The name \"Regiomontanus\" was first coined by Philipp Melanchthon in 1534, fifty-eight years after Regiomontanus' death.

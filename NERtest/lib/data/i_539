instance
Pope Agatho (died 10 January 681 AD) served as the Pope from 26 June 678 till his death in 681. He is venerated as a saint by both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. Little is known of Agatho before his papacy but he may have been among the many Sicilian clergy in Rome at that time, due to the Islamic Caliphate battles against Sicily in the mid-7th century.

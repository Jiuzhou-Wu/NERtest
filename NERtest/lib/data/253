class
A cycling team is a group of cyclists who join a team or are acquired and train together to compete in bicycle races whether amateur or professional - and the supporting personnel. Cycling teams are most important in road bicycle racing, which is a team sport, but collaboration between team members is also important in track cycling and cyclo-cross.

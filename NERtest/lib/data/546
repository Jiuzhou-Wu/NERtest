instance
Henry II of Hesse (German: Heinrich), (c. 1299 â€“ 3 June 1376) called \"the Iron\" was Landgrave of Hesse from 1328 - 1376. Henry was the son of Otto I, Landgrave of Hesse and Adelheid of Ravensburg. With his wife Elisabeth of Thuringia, daughter of Frederick I, Margrave of Meissen, he had five children: When Henry's son Otto died in 1366, his nephew Hermann was named co-regent. This caused fighting to break out with Otto of Brunswick. To defray the costs of the conflict with Brunswick, Henry levied a tax on all imported goods.

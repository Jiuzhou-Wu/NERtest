class
The politics of Saudi Arabia takes place in the context of an absolute monarchy, where the King of Saudi Arabia both head of state and the head of government, and decisions are, to a large extent, made on the basis of consultation among the senior princes of the royal family and the religious establishment. The Qur'an is declared to be the constitution of the country, which is governed on the basis of Islamic law (Shari'a). Government is dominated by the vast royal family, the Al Saud, which has often been divided by internal disputes and into factions. The members of the family are the principal political actors allowed by the government. Political participation outside of the royal family is limited, but there has been pressure for some time to broaden participation. In recent years[when?], there has been a rise in Islamist activism, which has also resulted in Islamist terrorism. According to at least some observers, \"traditionally\" issues such as foreign policy, national defense, and international affairs have been \"the purview of the state\" in Saudi Arabia, while \"justice, education, and family matters\", being related to religion, had been handled by \"the religious establishment\". However, in recent years, \"the Saudi state has been working to reclaim control of these areas.\"

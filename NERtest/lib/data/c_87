class
Advertising (or advertizing) is a form of marketing communication used to promote or sell something, usually a business's product or service. In Latin, ad vertere means \"to turn toward\". The purpose of advertising may also be to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful. Advertising messages are usually paid for by sponsors and viewed via various old media; including mass media such as newspaper, magazines, television advertisement, radio advertisement, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as blogs, websites or text messages. Commercial ads seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through \"branding,\" which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. Non-commercial advertisers who spend money to advertise items other than a consumer product or service include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement. Modern advertising was created with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays, considered the founder of modern, \"Madison Avenue\" advertising. In 2015, the world will spend about US$592.43 billion on advertising. Internationally, the largest (\"big four\") advertising conglomerates are Interpublic, Omnicom, Publicis, and WPP.

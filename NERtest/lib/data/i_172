
Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille
instance
Abbé Nicolas Louis de La Caille, sometimes spelled Lacaille, ([lakaj]; 28 December 1713 – 21 March 1762) was a French astronomer and priest. The birth date given here is that of his baptism; babies were normally baptised on the day that they were born. The traditional birth date of 15 March 1713 has been questioned due to many infants of the Roman Catholic Church being baptised on the day of their birth in the 17th and 18th centuries.

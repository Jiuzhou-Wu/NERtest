Surname
class
A surname or family name is a name added to a given name. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many dictionaries define \"surname\" as a synonym of \"family name\". In the western hemisphere, it is commonly synonymous with last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name. In most Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking countries, two or more last names (or surnames) may be used. In China, Hungary, Japan, Korea, Madagascar, Taiwan, Vietnam, and parts of India, the family name is placed before a person's given name. The style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (forename) is far from universal. In many countries, it is common for ordinary people to have only one name or mononym. The concept of a \"surname\" is a relatively recent historical development, evolving from a medieval naming practice called a \"byname\". Based on an individual's occupation or area of residence, a byname would be used in situations where more than one person had the same name.

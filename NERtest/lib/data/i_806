Pope Innocent XII (Latin: Innocentius XII; 13 March 1615 â€“ 27 September 1700), born Antonio Pignatelli, was Pope from 12 July 1691 to his death in 1700. He took a hard stance against nepotism in the church, continuing the policies of Pope Innocent XI, who started the battle against nepotism. To that end, he issued a papal bull strictly forbidding it.

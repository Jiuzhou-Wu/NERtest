Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki (Japanese: ラジカル・ドリーマーズ -盗めない宝石-, lit. \"Radical Dreamers: The Unstealable Jewel\") is a Japanese video game developed by Square in 1996 for the Satellaview add-on for the Nintendo Super Famicom. It is a text-based visual novel in which the player takes the role of Serge, a young adventurer accompanied by Kid, a teen-aged thief, and Gil, a mysterious masked magician. The game belongs to the Chrono series and is a gaiden, or side story, to the 1995 game Chrono Trigger. It was released to complement its predecessor's plot, and later served as inspiration for Chrono Cross. It features text-based gameplay with minimal graphics and sound effects, and was scored by composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Unlike many Satellaview titles, Radical Dreamers was not designed to lock after a certain number of playthroughs, so players owning an 8M Memory Pack onto which the game was downloaded can still play today. Square tried to integrate Radical Dreamers into the Japanese PlayStation port of Chrono Trigger as an Easter egg. Writer and director Masato Kato halted this and other releases, unhappy with the quality of his work. Though the game was never officially released abroad, ROM hackers completed an English fan translation in 2003.

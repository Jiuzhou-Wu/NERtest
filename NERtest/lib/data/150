Canadian Junior Football League
instance
The Canadian Junior Football League, formed May 8, 1974 is a national amateur Canadian football league consisting of 19 teams playing in six provinces across Canada. The teams compete annually for the Canadian Bowl. Many CJFL players moved on to professional football careers in the CFL and elsewhere. The CJFL's formal mission statement is: \"The Canadian Junior Football League provides the opportunity for young men aged 17 to 22 to participate in highly competitive post-high school football that is unique in Canada. The goal of the league is to foster community involvement and yield a positive environment by teaching discipline, perseverance and cooperation. The benefits of the league are strong camaraderie, national competition and life-long [sic] friends.\" A handful of standout players are typically signed directly to CFL rosters each season, while Canadian Interuniversity Sport permits up to two years of play in leagues such as the CJFL before a player begins to lose eligibility. The 9-team Quebec Junior Football League was formerly part of the CJFL, but eventually withdrew and now operates independently. Meanwhile, The Ontario Football Conference (OFC) is consisted of two divisions: Varsity Division (ages 11 to 19) and Junior Division (ages 17 to 24). While the Junior Division remains affiliated to the CJFL and its teams compete for the Canadian Bowl, the Varsity Division is operated solely by the OFC.

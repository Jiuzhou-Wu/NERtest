Robert Anton Wilson (born Robert Edward Wilson; January 18, 1932 â€“ January 11, 2007) was an American author, novelist, essayist, editor, playwright, poet, futurist, psychologist, and self-described agnostic mystic. Recognized as an Episkopos, Pope, and saint of Discordianism, Wilson helped publicize the group through his writings and interviews. Wilson described his work as an \"attempt to break down conditioned associations, to look at the world in a new way, with many models recognized as models or maps, and no one model elevated to the truth\". His goal being \"to try to get people into a state of generalized agnosticism, not agnosticism about God alone but agnosticism about everything.\"

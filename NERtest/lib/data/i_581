Aragonese (/ˌærəɡɒˈniːz/; aragonés [aɾaɣoˈnes] in Aragonese) is a Romance language spoken today in several local varieties by between 10,000 and 30,000 people throughout the valleys of the Pyrenees in Aragon, Spain, mainly in the comarcas of Somontano de Barbastro, Jacetania, Alto Gállego, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza. It is the only modern language that survived from medieval Navarro-Aragonese in a form distinctly different from Spanish. While informally known as fabla (\"talk\" or \"speech\"), Aragonese is also commonly referred to by the names of its numerous local dialects, such as cheso (from Valle de Hecho) or patués (from the valley of Benasque).

Politician
class
A politician (from Classical Greek ¦Ð?¦Ë¦É?, \"polis\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek positions within a government through elections or appointment. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \"politician\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.

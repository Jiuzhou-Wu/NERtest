class
College (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. Usage of the word college varies in English-speaking nations. A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate university, or an institution offering vocational education. In the United States and Italy, \"college\" formally refers to a constituent part of a university, but generally \"college\" and \"university\" are used interchangeably, whereas in Oceania and South Asia, \"college\" may refer to a secondary or high school, a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, or a constituent part of a university (See this comparison of British and American English educational terminology for further information).

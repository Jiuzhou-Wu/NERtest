Oberlin College is a private liberal arts college in Oberlin, Ohio, noteworthy for having been the first American institution of higher learning to regularly admit female and black students in addition to white males. The Oberlin Conservatory of Music, part of the college, is the oldest continuously operating conservatory in the country. Oberlin's school colors are cardinal red and mikado yellow, often casually referred to as \"crimson and gold.\" Those colors were formally designated for the college by a faculty committee in 1889 and were drawn from the family coat of arms of John Frederick Oberlin. They remain in the official registry of school colors maintained by the American Council on Education. Oberlin is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association and the Five Colleges of Ohio consortium.

Neapolitan sauce, also called Napoli sauce or Napoletana sauce is the collective name given (outside Italy) to various basic tomato-based sauces derived from Italian cuisine, often served over or alongside pasta. In Naples, Neapolitan sauce is simply referred to as la salsa, which literally translates to the sauce. Basil, bay leaf, thyme, oregano, peppercorns, cloves, olives, and mushrooms may be included depending on taste preferences. Some variants include carrots and celery. The basic sauce is vegetarian, although meat such as ground beef or sausage can be added. Italians refer to Neapolitan sauce only in association with other recipes, for instance, 'spaghetti napolitana'. The sauce is a mainstay of Southern Italy as meat was traditionally scarce, with Bolognese sauce being attributed to Northern Italy. This sauce is also widely used in Italian-American cuisine, which has diverged from its Old World origins.

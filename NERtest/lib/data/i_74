instance
EA Maxis is a subsidiary of Electronic Arts (EA), serving as one of its four major video game development labels. The company was originally founded in 1987 as Maxis Software, an American independent video game development company, and later simply became known as Maxis. Maxis is the creator of one of the best-selling computer games of all time, The Sims (2000), its first major sequel The Sims 2 (2004), and the majority of their later expansions. After much restructuring of development of The Sims series since The Sims 2, EA Maxis released The Sims 4 in September 2014. Maxis' Emeryville studio was closed in March 2015, consolidating development of Maxis titles to EA's main studio locations, where development of The Sims and SimCity will continue. Employees of the Emeryville studio were offered other positions within Maxis and other EA studios. Most Maxis titles are simulation-based. Maxis founder Will Wright likens them to \"digital dollhouses\".[citation needed] Maxis has also released games developed by other production houses, such as A-Train (1992, for Artdink) and SimTower (1994 for OPeNBook Co., Ltd.).

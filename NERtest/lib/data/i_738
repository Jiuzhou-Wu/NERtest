instance
The Porsche 944 is a luxury sports car that was built by Porsche from 1982 to 1991. It used the 924 platform that remained in production until 1988. The 944 was intended to last into the 1990s, but major revisions planned for a 944 \"S3\" model were eventually combined into the 968 instead, which replaced the 944. The 944 was available in coup√© or cabriolet body styles, with either naturally aspirated or turbocharged engines.

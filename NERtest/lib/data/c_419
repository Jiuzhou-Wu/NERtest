
Dubbing (filmmaking)
class
Dubbing, mixing, or re-recording is a post-production process used in filmmaking and video production in which additional or supplementary recordings are \"mixed\" with original production sound to create the finished soundtrack. The process usually takes place on a dub stage. After sound editors edit and prepare all necessary tracks (dialogue, automated dialogue replacement (ADR), effects, Foley, and music), the dubbing mixer or mixers proceed to balance all of the elements and record the finished soundtrack. Dubbing is sometimes confused with ADR, also known as \"additional dialogue replacement\", \"additional dialogue recording\", and \"looping\", in which the original actors re-record and synchronize audio segments. Outside the film industry, the term \"dubbing\" most commonly refers to the replacement of the voices of the actors shown on the screen with those of different performers speaking another language, which is called \"revoicing\" in the film industry.


Equity (trade union)
instance
Equity (formerly known as the British Actors' Equity Association) is the trade union for actors, stage managers and models in the United Kingdom. It was formed in 1930 by a group of West End performers and, in 1967, it incorporated the Variety Artistes' Federation. Equity was one of the last of the closed shop unions in the UK. This was criticised in 1981 by the European Court of Human Rights and made illegal in 1988, with the result that it is no longer a requirement that an entertainment professional be a member of Equity. Equity requires its members to have unique professional names.

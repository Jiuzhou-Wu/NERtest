Year 2 (II) was a common year starting on Sunday or Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar (the sources differ, see leap year error for further information) and a common year starting on Sunday of the proleptic Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Vinicius and Varus (or, less frequently, year 755 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 2 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

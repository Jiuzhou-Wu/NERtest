
NCAA Men's Division II Tennis Championship
instance
The NCAA Division II Men's Tennis Championship is an annual men's college tennis national collegiate championship sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for teams in Division II. Unlike the championships for Division I and Division III, this tournament crowns only a team champion. Individual and doubles titles were contested from 1963 to 1994 before being discontinued. The championship first began in 1963 as the NCAA College Division Men's Tennis Championship for smaller colleges and universities not in the larger University Division (the precursor to the current Division I). The tournament gained its current name when the NCAA introduced its three-division structure in 1973â€“74. The national championship rounds are contested annually in May.

instance
Pinconning Cheese is an aged yellow colby-style, semi-soft whole cow's milk cheese named for Pinconning, Michigan, in the United States, where it was first produced. It was developed by Dan Horn in 1915 as an aged version of Colby. Pinconning Cheese is produced at several plants around Michigan and the United States. Pinconning's flavor and texture are unusual, rich and creamy with an open texture. It is typically eaten instead of Cheddar and Colby, and serves well in macaroni and cheese or in souffl√©s. Other products made from Pinconning Cheese are cheese spreads in many flavors.

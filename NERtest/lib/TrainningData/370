Kipper (born Mark Eldridge) is a Grammy winning Guitarist, keyboardist and music producer, known mostly from his cooperation with Gary Numan and Sting.Kipper had his own band, One Nation. After releasing two albums with One Nation he joined the Gary Numan band playing guitar. After realizing his own music was going in a similar direction as Kipper's previous work, Numan asked him to co-produce his 1992 LP Machine and Soul. The album was a mix of funk, rock and dance pop featuring guitar playing from Kipper. Kipper also contributed to Numan's 1994 album \"Sacrifice\" although to a much lesser extent. Years later Kipper participated in Sting's past two studio albums Brand New Day and Sacred Love. Both albums have been critically acclaimed and feature a modern fusion of jazz, rock and electronic styles and sounds.

The National Golf Foundation (NGF) provides golf-business research and consulting services. Founded in 1936 by golf writer Herb Graffis and his brother Joe, who nearly went bankrupt in the process, its original mission was to publish authoritative research useful to investors developing the game of golf. As of 2007 it had 6000 member companies.

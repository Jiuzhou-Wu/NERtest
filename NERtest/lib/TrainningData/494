The British Supersport Championship, National Superstock 1000 & 600 and the British Motostar Championship are the four main championship series that are run as support races alongside the British Superbike Championship. In 2012 the Motostar category replaced the defunct 125cc category that had been running since the start of the British Superbike Championship in 1988, Motostar was open to both 125 and 250 machines similar to Moto 3 machines. The Supersport racing started in 1989 and is a class comprising 600cc Motorcycles that are allowed racing modifications and custom tuning. It wasn't until 2000 that the Superstock 1000 category replaced the defunct 250cc category, with the Superstock 600 championship being the newest addition on the support series in 2008. In 2010 the Superstock 1000 and Superstock 600 categories also supported the British rounds of the Superbike World Championship and the Moto GP both at Silverstone.
